A gentle introduction to concurrency patterns in Go

Browse the various branches of this repo to see each code example.

This repo will serve as a supplement to my Lightning Talk, "Concurrent Programming with Go". It is aimed at those inexperienced with concurrenct programming concepts, but who know the bare-bones basics of Go.

For more information, check out Rob Pike's excellent video lecture, "Go Concurrency Patterns".
